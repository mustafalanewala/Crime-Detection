# Crime Detection and Prediction Model

This project focuses on detecting and predicting crime patterns by identifying spatial and temporal crime hotspots using machine learning. By analyzing real-world crime datasets, we aim to forecast potential crime locations, frequent times of occurrence, and the types of crimes likely to occur in specific areas at particular times.

## Project Details
- **Developers:**
  - Mustafa Lanewala, B.Tech AI 5th SEM, 22C22033 (AI)
  - Murtuza Mahudawala, B.Tech AI 5th SEM, 22C22011 (AI)
  - Abdeali Khanrahim, B.Tech AI 5th SEM, 22C22009 (AI)

- **Objectives:**
  - Identify crime hotspots based on location and time.
  - Forecast possible future crimes in a specific location and time period.
  - Provide a detailed analysis of crime data by integrating it with demographic information.

## Methodology
The model employs **Time Series Forecasting** and **Clustering** techniques to analyze and predict crime trends. Key steps include:

1. **Data Collection**: Real-world crime data and relevant demographic information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data for optimal analysis.
3. **Clustering**: Grouping data to identify crime hotspots.
4. **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future crime events based on past patterns.

## Features
- **Crime Hotspot Detection**: Identifies locations with a high frequency of crimes.
- **Time-based Crime Prediction**: Predicts the most likely times for different types of crimes.
- **Demographic Integration**: Enhances crime pattern analysis by incorporating demographic data.
- **Visualizations**: Outputs results as interactive graphs and plots for better insights.
